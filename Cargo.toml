# Cargo patch rules for all the paritytech/ based crates.
#
# With the rules below, we tell cargo that whenever it finds a crate with source in `paritytech/*`, it should use
# the specific revision of the respective repository at hand, avoiding duplicated crates from tainting compilation.

# Cargo patch for moonbeam-foundation based crates
#
# moonbeam-foundation maintains their own forks of Parity's Substrate, Polkadot, and Cumulus,
# and of open-web3-stack's ORML. By depending on crates from the mbeam repository, we are indirectly pulling crates
# from these forked reposities, which lead to multiple cargo issues due to duplication versions of crates being found.
# With the rules below, we tell cargo that whenever it finds a crate with source in `moonbeam-foundation/`, that it should use
# the specific official revision of the respective repository at hand.

# Cargo patch rules for all the moonbeam foundation crates
